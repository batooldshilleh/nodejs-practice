**Setup:**
- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Create a file named server.js in your project directory.
- Open the terminal and run the following command to initialize a package.json file: npm init -y

### Project 2: [guessNumberGame]
